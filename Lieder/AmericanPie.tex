\beginsong{American Pie}[wuw={Don McLean}]



\beginverse
A \[G]long, \[D/F#]long tim\[Em]e ago

\[Am]I can still re\[C]member how that mus\[Em]ic used to make me s\[D]mile\[Dsus4]\[D]\[Dsus2]\[D]

And \[G]I knew \[D/F#]if I ha\[Em]d my chance

That \[Am]I could make those \[C]people dance and \[Em]maybe they'd be \[C]happy for a w\[D]hile\[Dsus4]\[D]\[Dsus2]\[D]

\[Em]  But February \[Am]made me shiver,\[Em] with every paper \[Am]I'd deliver

\[C]Bad news \[G/B]on the \[Am]doorstep, I cou\[C]ldn't take one more step\[D]

I \[G]can't remem\[D/F#]ber if I \[Em]cried when I \[C]read about his \[D]widowed bride

\[G]Something \[D/F#]touched me \[Em]deep inside

The \[C]day the \[D]music \[G]died
\endverse

\beginchorus
So \[G]bye, \[C]bye Miss \[G]American \[D]Pie

Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levee but the \[G]levee was \[D]dry

And them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye

Singin' \[Em*]this will be the day that I \[A7*]die, \[Em*]this will be the day that I \[D7]die\[D7sus2]\[D7]\[D7sus4]\[D7]\[D7sus2]\[D7]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G]Did you write the \[Am]book of love

And do \[C]you have faith in \[Am]God above, \[Em]if the bible \[D]tells you so?

\[G]Do you \[D/F#]believe in r\[Em]ock and roll

Can \[Am7]music save your\[C] mortal soul an\[Em]d can you teach me \[A7]how to dance \[D]real slow?

Well I \[Em*]know that you're in l\[D*]ove with him 'cuz I s\[Em*]aw you dancin' i\[D*]n the gym

You \[C]both kicked \[G/B]off your \[Am]shoes, man I \[C]dig those rhythm and \[D7]blues

I was a \[G]lonely \[D/F#]teenage b\[Em]ronckin' buck with a \[Am]pink carnation and a \[C]pickup truck

But \[G]I knew\[D/F#] I was o\[Em]ut of luck the d\[C]ay the m\[D7]usic d\[G]ied\[C],  \[G]I started \[D]singin'

\beginverse
Now for t\[G]en years we've been \[Am]on our own

and mo\[C]ss grows fat on a ro\[Am]lling stone \[Em]but that's not how it u\[D]sed to be\[Dsus4]\[D]\[Dsus2]\[D]

When the j\[G]ester \[D/F#]sang for the kin\[Em]g and queen

in a \[Am7]coat he borrowed fr\[C]om James Dean in a v\[Em]oice that came \[A7]from you and\[D]me

Oh, and w\[Em*]hile the king was lo\[D*]oking down, the j\[Em*]ester stole his thor\[D*]ny crown

The c\[C]ourtroom \[G/B]was ad\[A7]journed, \[C]no verdict was re\[D7]turned

And while \[G]Lennin rea\[D/F#]d a bo\[Em]ok on Marx, the\[Am] quartet prac\[C]ticed in the park

And \[G]we sang \[D/F#]dirges \[Em]in the dark the d\[C]ay the m\[D7]usic d\[G]ied\[C],  \[G] we were \[D]singin'
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
\[G]Helter skelter in a \[Am]summer swelter

\[C]the birds flew off with\[Am] a fallout shelter,\[Em] eight miles high and f\[D]allin' fast

It lan\[G]ded \[D/F#]foul o\[Em]n the grass

the pl\[Am7]ayers tried for a f\[C]orward pass, \[Em]with the jester on the sideline\[A7]s in a \[D]cast

Now the h\[Em*]alf-time air was s\[D*]weet perfume, while \[Em*]sergeants played a m\[D*]arching tune

\[C]We all got \[G/B]up to dan\[A7]ce, but \[C]we never got the ch\[D7]ance

'Cuz the \[G]players t\[D/F#]ried to t\[Em]ake the field, \[Am]the marching band re\[Cm]fused to y\[C]ield

\[G]Do you rec\[D/F#]all what w\[Em]as revealed the d\[C]ay the m\[D7]usic d\[G]ied\[C],  \[G] we started \[D]singin'
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
And t\[G]here we were all \[Am]in one place

a \[C]generation \[Am]lost in space, with \[Em]no time left to s\[D]tart again\[Dsus4]\[D]\[Dsus2]\[D]

So come on J\[G]ack be \[D/F#]nimble, \[Em]Jack be quick, \[Am7]Jack Flash sat on a \[C]candlestick

'cause\[Em] fire is the \[A7]devil's only fr\[D]iend

And a\[Em*]s I watched him o\[D*]n the stage, my h\[Em*]ands were clenched in f\[D*]ists of rage

No \[C]angel b\[G/B]orn in \[A7]Hell could \[C]break that Satan's \[D7]spell

And as the \[G]flames climbe\[D/F#]d high int\[Em]o the night to \[Am]light the sacrif\[C]icial rite

I saw \[G]Satan \[D/F#]laughing \[Em]with delight the d\[C]ay the m\[D7]usic d\[G]ied\[C],  \[G] he was \[D]singin'
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
\[G]I met a \[D/F#]girl who \[Em]sang the blues

And I \[Am]asked her for some \[C]happy news, but \[Em]she just smiled and \[D]turned away

\[G]I went dow\[D/F#]n to the \[Em]sacred store

Where I\[Am]'d heard the mus\[C]ic years before, but the \[Em]man there said the m\[C]usic

wouldn't p\[D]lay

And \[Em*]in the streets the \[Am*]children screamed, the \[Em*]lovers cried and the \[Am*]poets dreamed

But \[C]not a \[G/B]word was \[Am]spoken, the \[C]church bells all were \[D]broken

And the \[G]three men \[D/F#]I admi\[Em]re most, the \[C]Father, Son, and the Ho\[D]ly Ghost

\[G]They caught the \[D/F#]last train \[Em]for the coast the \[C]day the \[D]music \[G]died,

N.C.
And they were singin'
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Bye, \[C]bye Miss \[G]American \[D]Pie

Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levee but the \[G]levee was \[D]dry

And them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye

Singin' \[Em*]this will be the day that I \[A7]die, \[Em*]this will be the day that I \[D7]die\[D7sus2]\[D7]\[D7sus4]\[D7]\[D7sus2]\[D7]

They were singin' \[G]bye, \[C]bye Miss \[G]American \[D]Pie

Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levee but the \[G]levee was \[D]dry

And them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye

Singin' \[C]this will be the \[D7]day that I \[G]die\[C]\[G]
