\beginverse
This big ol' wo\[D]rld sure got me running 'rou\[G]nd
I heard a voi\[D]ce that said, 'Just settle \[A]down'\[A7]
And with the moonl\[D]ight as my gui\[D7]de
And with this feel\[G]ing deep inside
I know no\[D]w that I\[A] am homeward bou\[D]nd

As I \[D]Wander through the pines, the wh\[G]isper, they tell
Of \[D]many before \[A]tried and \[A7]fell
Seeking \[D]fortune and wa\[D7]ys
To \[G]get to glory days
Looking \[D]for a \[A]place in this old \[D]world
