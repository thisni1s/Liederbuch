\beginverse
I am \[Dm]just an aging drummer boy, and in the \[C]wars I used to play
And I've \[Bb]called the tune to many a torture \[Dm]session
Now they say I am a war criminal, and I'm \[C]fading away
\[Bb]Father, please hear my con\[Dm]fession

\beginverse
I have \[G]legalized robbery, \[D]called it belief
I have \[G]run with the money, I have \[D]hid like a thief
\[G]Re-written history with \[D]armies and my crooks
Invented \[C]memories\[Am], I did \[D]burn all the books
\endverse

\beginverse
And I can \[Dm]still hear his laughter,
And I can \[C]still hear his \[Em]song
The man's too \[Em]big;
The man's too \[D]st\[C]rong\[D]\[C]\[Cm]\[G]
\[Gm]    \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
Well I \[G]tried to be meek, I have \[D]tried to be mild
But I \[G]spat like a woman, and \[D]sulked like a child
I have \[G]lived behind walls, that have \[D]made me alone
Striven for \[C]peace\[Am], which I \[D]never have known
\endverse

\beginverse
And I can \[Dm]still hear his laughter,
And I can \[C]still hear his \[Em]song
The man's too \[Em]big;
The man's too \[D]st\[C]rong\[D]\[C]\[Cm]\[G]
\[Gm]    \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
Well the \[G]sun rose on the courtyard, and they \[D]all did hear him say
"You \[G]always was a Judas, but I \[D]got you anyway
You \[G]may have got your silver, but I \[D]swear upon my life
Your sister gave me \[C]diamonds\[Am], and I \[D]gave 'em to your wife"
\endverse


\beginverse
Oh father, please \[Dm]help me,
For \[C]I have done \[Em]wrong
The man's too \[Em]big;
The man's too \[D]st\[C]rong\[D]\[C]\[Cm]\[G]

\[Gm] \[F] \[Fm] \[C] \[Am] \[F]\[D]
