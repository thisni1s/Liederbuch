\beginverse
To the t\[C]own of Agua Fria rode a \[Am]stranger one fine day
Hardly s\[C]poke to folks around him, didn't have too much to s\[Am]ay
No one d\[F]ared to ask his business, no one d\[C]ared to make a slip
for the stranger there amongst them had a b\[Am]ig iron on his hip
B\[F]ig iron on his h\[C]ip
\endverse

\beginverse
It was e\[C]arly in the morning when he \[Am]rode into the town
He came r\[C]idin' from the south side slowly lookin' all a\[Am]round
He's an o\[F]utlaw loose and runnin' came the w\[C]hisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the b\[Am]ig iron on his hip
b\[F]ig iron on his h\[C]ip
\endverse

\beginverse
In this t\[C]own there lived an outlaw by the \[Am]name of Texas Red
Many m\[C]en had tried to take him and that many men were d\[Am]ead
He was v\[F]icious and a killer though a y\[C]outh of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered o\[Am]ne and nineteen more
O\[F]ne and nineteen m\[C]ore
\endverse

\beginverse
Now the s\[C]tranger started talking, made it \[Am]plain to folks around
Was an A\[C]rizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in t\[Am]own
He came h\[F]ere to take an outlaw back a\[C]live or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was a\[Am]fter Texas Red
A\[F]fter Texas R\[C]ed
\endverse

\beginverse
Wasn't lo\[C]ng before the story was re\[Am]layed to Texas Red
But the o\[C]utlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were d\[Am]ead
Twenty m\[F]en had tried to take him, twenty m\[C]en had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the b\[Am]ig iron on his hip
B\[F]ig iron on his h\[C]ip
\endverse

\beginverse
The m\[C]orning passed so quickly, it was \[Am]time for them to meet
It was t\[C]wenty past eleven when they walked out in the s\[Am]treet
Folks were w\[F]atching from their windows, everyb\[C]ody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was a\[Am]bout to meet his death
A\[F]bout to meet his d\[C]eath
\endverse

\beginverse
There was f\[C]orty feet between them when they \[Am]stopped to make their play
And the s\[C]wiftness of the ranger is still talked about tod\[Am]ay
Texas R\[F]ed had not cleared leather 'fore a b\[C]ullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the b\[Am]ig iron on his hip
B\[F]ig iron on his h\[C]ip
\endverse

\beginverse
It was o\[C]ver in a moment and the \[Am]folks had gathered round
There b\[C]efore them lay the body of the outlaw on the g\[Am]round
Oh, he m\[F]ight have gone on living but he m\[C]ade one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the b\[Am]ig iron on his hip
B\[F]ig iron on his h\[C]ip
\endverse

\beginverse*
Big i\[F]ron, big \[C]iron
When he t\[C]ried to match the ranger with the b\[Am]ig iron on his hip
B\[F]ig iron on his h\[C]ip
\endverse
