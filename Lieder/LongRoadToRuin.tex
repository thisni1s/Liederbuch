\beginverse
\[C]Here now, don't make a sound
Say, have you heard the news t\[F]oday
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its plac\[C]e
\endverse 

\beginverse
A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unc\[F]hanged
No harm, no life, no love
No stranger singing in your name
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]But maybe the \[B]season
The \[C]colors change in the v\[B]alley skies
\[Am]Dear God, I've \[B]sealed my fate
\[C]Running through hell, 
\[D]heaven can wait
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]Long road to ruin 
\[C]there in your eyes
\[F]Under the cold street\[C]lights
\[Am]No tomorrow, 
\[D]no dead end in \[F]sight
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[C]Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any \[F]state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the \[G]gates
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a \[F]name
Head on without a care
\[F]Before it's way too late
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]But maybe the \[B]season
The \[C]colors change in the v\[B]alley skies
\[Am]Dear God, I've \[B]sealed my fate

\[D]heaven can wait
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Cadd9]For every piece \[B]to fall in place \[Cadd9]
Forever \[B]gone without a tr\[Cadd9]ace
Your hor\[B]izon takes its shape
\[Am7]No turning back, don't\[B] turn that page
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am7]Come now, I'm l\[B]leaving here \[C]tonight
Come now, t\[B]let's leave it all \[Am7]behind
Is that the [B]price you pay?
\[C]Running through hell, 
heaven can wait
