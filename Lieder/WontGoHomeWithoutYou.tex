\beginverse
I \[C]asked her to stay, but she wouldn't \[Dm]listen.
And she \[G]left before I had the chance to \[C]say, o\[C/h]h...
The \[Am]words that would mend, the things that were bro\[Dm]ken,
but \[F]now it's far too \[G]late, she's gone a\[C]way.
\endverse

\beginverse*
\textnote{\bf Pre-Chorus}
Every \[C]night you cry yourself to sleep,
thinking: ''\[Am]Why does this happen to me?
Why does \[D7/F#]every moment have to be so \[F]hard?''
\[G] Hard to believe that...
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]It's not over tonight
Just give me one more \[Dm]chance to make it right
I may not make it \[F]through the night,
I \[G]won't go home with\[C]out you...
\endchorus

\beginverse
The ^taste of her breath, I'll never get o^ver.
The ^noises that you made kept me a^wake, o^h...
The ^weight of the things that remained un^spoken
built ^up so much it ^crushed us every^day.
\endverse

\repchorus{2}

\beginverse*
\textnote{\bf Bridge}
\[H&]Of all the \[F]things I felt but \[C]never really \[G]shown.
\[E&] Perhaps the \[H&]worst is that I \[F]ever let you \[G]go,
I should not ever let you \[G]go, oh, oh, oh...
\endverse


\repchorus{2}
\beginchorus
I won't go home with\[C]out you...
I won't go home wit\[Am]hout you...
I \[F]won't go home wit\[C]hout you!
