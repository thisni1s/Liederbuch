{\nolyrics Intro: \[Em] \[C] \[G] \[D] }
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Em]  I'm tired of being what you \[C]want me to be
\[G]Feeling so faithless lost \[D]under the surface
\[Em]  Don't know what you're ex\[C]pecting of me
Put \[G]under the pressure of \[D]walking in your sh\[C]oes\[D]
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every \[Em]step I take is an\[G]other mistake to \[C]you\[D]
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Em]I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
I've become so \[D]tired, so much more a\[Em]ware
I'm becoming \[C]this, all I want to \[G]do
Is be more like \[D]me and be less like \[Em]you
\endchorus

\beginverse
Can't you see that you're \[C]smothering me
\[G]Holding too tightly a\[D]fraid to lose contr\[Em]ol
Cause everything that you tho\[C]ught I would be
Has \[G]fallen apart r\[D]ight in front of \[C]you\[D]
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every \[Em]step that I take is an\[G]other mistake to \[C]you\[D]
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every \[Em]second I waste is more than \[G]I can ta\[D]ke
\endverse

\beginchorus
And I \[D]know
I may \[Em]end \[D/F#]up   \[G]fail\[Bm7]ing \[C]too
But I kn\[D]ow
You were \[B]just like me with someone \[Bsus4]disappointed in you
\endchorus

\beginchorus
\[Em]I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
I've become so \[D]tired, so much more a\[Em]ware
I'm becoming \[C]this, all I want to \[G]do
Is be more like \[D]me and be less like \[Em]you
I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
(Tired of being what you w\[D]ant me to be)
\[Em]I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
(Tired of being what you w\[D]ant me to be)
