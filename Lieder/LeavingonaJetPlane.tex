\beginverse
All my \[G]bags are packed, I'm \[C]ready to go, 
I'm \[G]standing here out\[C]side the door, 
I \[G]hate to wake you \[C]up to say good\[D]bye. 
But the \[G]dawn is breakin', it's early \[C]morn'in, 
the \[G]taxi's waitin', he's \[C]blowin' his horn. 
Al\[G]ready I'm so \[C]lonesome I could \[D]die.
\endverse

\beginchorus
So \[G]kiss me and \[C]smile for me, \[G]tell me that you'll \[C]wait for me, 
\[G]hold me like you'll \[C]never let me \[D]go. 
Cause I'm \[G]leavin \[C]on a jet plane, \[G]don't know when \[C]I'll be back again. \[G]
Oh \[C]babe, I hate to \[D]go.
\endchorus

\beginverse
There's ^so many times I've ^let you down, 
So ^many times I've ^played around, 
I ^tell you now they ^don't mean a ^thing. 
Every ^place I go I'll ^think of You 
Every ^song I sing I'll ^sing for you. 
When ^I come back I'll ^bring your wedding^ring.
\endverse

\beginverse
Now the ^time has ^come to leave you, 
^One more time ^let me kiss you, 
Then ^close your eyes and ^I'll be on my ^way. 
^Dream about the ^days to come, 
When ^I won't have to ^leave you alone, 
A^bout the times I ^won't have to ^say.
