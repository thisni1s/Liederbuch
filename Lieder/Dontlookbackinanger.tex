'Cos you \[F]said the brains I \[Fm]had went to my \[C]head.
\[F]Step outside, the \[Fm]summertime's in \[C]bloom.
\[G]Stand up beside the fireplace!
\[E7]Take that look from off your face!
'Cos \[Am]you ain't ever \[G]gonna burn my \[F]heart ouu\[G]uuuuuuuuuuuuuut.

\[C]So \[G]Sally can \[Am]wait, she \[E]knows it's too \[F]late
as we're \[G]walking on \[C]by. \[Am]\[G]
Her \[C]soul \[G]slides a\[Am]way, \[E7] but don't look \[F]back in anger \[G]
I heard you \[C]say. \[G] \[Am] \[E] \[F] \[G] \[C] \[Am]\[G]
