[Verse 1]

        C                       Am

To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day

        C                                                  Am

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say

        F                                 C

No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip

                                           Am

for the stranger there amongst them had a big iron on his hip

 F               C

Big iron on his hip

 

 

[Verse 2]

        C                           Am

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town

         C                                             Am

He came ridin' from the south side slowly lookin' all around

         F                                 C

He's an outlaw loose and runnin' came the whisper from each lip

                                            Am

And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip

 F               C

big iron on his hip

 

 

[Verse 3]

         C                                Am

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red

      C                                                Am

Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead

        F                             C

He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four

                                        Am

And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more

 F                C

One and nineteen more

 

 

[Verse 4]

         C                                Am

Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around

        C                                       Am

Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town

         F                           C

He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead

                                      Am

And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red

 F           C

After Texas Red

 

 

[Verse 5]

         C                         Am

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red

         C                                               Am

But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead

        F                                 C

Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip

                                         Am

Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip

 F               C

Big iron on his hip

 

 

[Verse 6]

     C                                Am

The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet

        C                                              Am

It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street

            F                                 C

Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath

                                    Am

They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death

 F                 C

About to meet his death

 

 

[Verse 7]

           C                                Am

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play

         C                                               Am

And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today

       F                                   C

Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped

                                          Am

And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip

 F               C

Big iron on his hip

 

 

[Verse 8]

        C                       Am

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round

       C                                             Am

There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

        F                                C

Oh, he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip

                                            Am

When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip

 F               C

Big iron on his hip

 

 

[Outro]

     F        C

Big iron, big iron

         C                                  Am

When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip

 F               C

Big iron on his hip
